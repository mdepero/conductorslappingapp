# Notes

This app models the arc flash incident energy based on *1584-2002 -
IEEE Guide for Performing Arc Flash Hazard Calculations*. The results
are based on regression models from a series of tests on equipment.
Most of the tests were based on vertical busbars in boxes. IEEE 1584
states that these regression equations are applicable for the
following ranges of variables:

- Voltages in the range of 208 V - 15 kV, three-phase.
- Frequencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz.
- Bolted fault current in the range of 700 A - 106 kA.
- Grounding of all types and ungrounded.
- Equipment enclosures of commonly available sizes.
- Gaps between conductors of 13 mm - 152 mm (0.5 - 6 in).
- Faults involving three phases.

Note that for voltages above 15 kV, this app continues to use the 1584
regression equations. This is based on analysis and tests reported in
EPRI 1018693 [2009], EPRI 1022697 [2011], and Short [2011]. The system
voltage has little to do with arc energies at medium voltage. The main
impact is from arc lengths, and these are determined by equipment
spacing. Equipment bus and enclosure spacings only moderately increase
across distribution voltages. Tests mimicking the IEEE 1584 tests
found that increasing bus spacings did not increase arc energies, and
increased enclosure sizes decreased incident energies.

For equipment operated at 480 V and below, these calculations do not
account for self-extinguishing arcs. Depending on electrode size,
arrangements, spacings, voltage, and enclosure characteristics, faults
may not sustain continuously. Arcs may burn out or expand and self
extinguish. See section 14.8 and also the NESC [IEEE C2-2012] and
Eblen and Short [2012] for more information, especially information on
incident energies for utility equipment that are much lower than IEEE
1584 predictions.

Because the IEEE 1584 tests were based on vertical electrodes, the
results may underpredict incident energies for equipment with
horizontal bus bars. See [this app](mdpad.html?arc_flash_padsw.md) for
arc flash calculations for a padmounted switch with horizontal
electrodes.

The IEEE 1584 working group is working on updating this model to
account for a wider range of equipment conditions and to account for
other bus geometries.
